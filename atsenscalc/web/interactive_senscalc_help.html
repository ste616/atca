      <h2>Help: Image Weighting</h2>
      The sensitivity calculator uses Robust weighting only when computing the image
      weighting factors, since Robust weighting is preferable over Natural and Uniform
      schemes. When using Robust weighting, Robust=2 is essentially Natural weighting,
      and Robust=-2 is essentially Uniform. The weighting factor shown in the image
      parameters table describes exactly how the image RMS noise would compare to a
      traditionally Natural-weighted image.

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="weatherConditions">
      <h2>Help: Weather Conditions</h2>
      The weather conditions used by the sensitivity calculator are derived from a
      study into the variations in temperature, pressure and humidity observed at
      the ATCA site over the past five years. The atmospheric opacity was derived
      from these parameters, and this was used to select the best, worst and typical
      conditions used by the calculator for each season that can be selected. You
      should expect that although you can have the "best" weather conditions for a
      short time during your observations, you will probably never reach the sensitivity
      shown in the "best" case. You should also always do better than the "worst"
      case. The sensitivity shown for "typical" weather conditions should be very
      close to what you would get for a normal observation in the selected season.
